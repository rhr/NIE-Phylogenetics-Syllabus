# Overview

The course will provide an introduction to phylogenetic methods, emphasizing their application to ecological research. The main topics will cover basic tree reconstruction from DNA sequence data, sources of phylogenetic information, comparative analysis of phenotypic traits, and metrics for studies of community assembly and conservation.

The format will be 2-hour sessions: 30--45 minutes of lecture and discussion, and 75--90 minutes of hands-on computer exercises and tutorials.
